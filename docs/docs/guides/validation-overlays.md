# Validation Overlays

*This guide is coming soon.*

ReActionView can display validation errors and template issues directly in the browser as overlays, providing immediate feedback during development without crashing your application.

## Overview

Validation overlays provide:

- Real-time error feedback in the browser
- Template validation results
- Better development experience
- Non-blocking error display

## How It Works

When validation mode is set to `:overlay`, ReActionView will display validation errors and template issues as HTML overlays instead of raising exceptions.
